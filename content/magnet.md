title: Magnet

If electricity comes from amber, magnet comes from lodestones. Sometime between 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE, Ancient Chinese discovered 3 important points:
- certain stones (lodestones) could attract iron and steel
- if the iron or steel is rubbed against lodestones, the iron and steel would temporarily attract each other too (in other words, it mimic the properties of lodestone)
- furthermore, if the lodestone is suspended in a way that it is free to move, it will align itself in a north-south direction.
 
By this point, the term magnet, magnetism, magnetic field is not yet popularized. Using today's knwoledge, we can define:
- lodestones are natural magnets
- lodestones' attraction towards iron property is now called magnetism
- the earth is a giant magnet
- the north-south alignment is the earth's magnetic field

### Artificial Magnet

Following the observation that magnetism from rubbing lodestones can be applied to iron, people started to find more ways to create magnetism property without using lodestones.

It was discovered in 11th century CE in China that, if an extreme heat is applied on iron and then the iron is cooled down while being aligned with the north-south direction, the iron will have permanent magnetism. This process is now called magnetization - the process of creating magnet.

There is no recorded history on how exactly this was discovered, but perhaps it was because blacksmithing and metalworking were common during this period.

### Compass

One of the most important benefit of making articial magnets is to be able to shape and customize magnet for various purposes. 

Initially, natural lodestones were used for as the earliest version of compass. But, it was not practical. People had to suspend or float them on water to let them align themselves to north-south direction. 

With the ability to create articial magnets, compass was improved and produced in a more convenient shape design and more practical to use. By 12th to 13th centuries, artificial magnet compass was spread further, widely used by sailors and explorers more confidently.
