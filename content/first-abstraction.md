title: First Abstraction
---

In computer science as well as in lots of other fields of study, the term "abstraction" is often used. It's probably one of my favorite ideas that ever invented or discovered by human!

### Abstraction 

Abstraction refers to the way of lower-level ideas being simplified when discussing about higher-level idea. For example, we want to read in our room. We flip the light switch and the light turns on. In order to achieve our goal of lighting the room, we only need to know how to flip the switch. We don't need to know how electricity flows from the switch we flip to the light bulb, and how the light bulb works providing light. This is abstraction.

There are many other options of abstractions that we encounter in our daily life:
- when we send a text through a smartphone, we just type and press "send", we don't know how the network processes our texts and deliver it to the right recipient, or how the system protects our message from bad actors
- when we withdraw money from ATM, we just insert our card and input our PIN, we don't know how that specific ATM machine communicates with the bank system, authenticate that our PIN matches our card, and displays amount of money we have in our account

When an idea is abstracted, we also generalize the idea and ignore details that are unimportant to the higher-level conversation. 

For example, we say "shoes" when the actual shoes have more details such as: made from leather, colored dark brown, size 41, was just polished, stored in a box on grandma's top shelf. 


### Our First Abstraction

In earlier materials, we talked about how we can implement logic gates with using relays. We can connect them in series for an AND gate, or in parallel for OR gate, or a normally closed contact relay for an NOT gate.

However, since we will move towards building more complex logic blocks, we will simplify them into just saying AND, OR, or NOT gate. We will not go to detail on the actual switches that we need to use. We will cautiously ignore the physical implementation for now, and abstract these gates using diagram.
