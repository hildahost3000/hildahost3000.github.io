title: Sequential Logic Introduction
---

The main difference between sequential logic and combinational logic is memory. Combinational logic produces output depending on curent inputs. However, sequential logic produces output based on current input and past input. Sequential logic's ability to remember the past is what makes it crucial to develop systems like computer.

### Clock

To remember the previous input or state, sequential logic circuit accepts inputs and clock signals. Clock signals is used for timing and synchronization. Since we are operating in binary, the clock signal is also operates between 1 and 0, high and low states.
