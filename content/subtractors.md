title: Subtractors
---

After addition with adders, the next mandatory calculation is substraction. This can be performed by using subtractors. Similar like adders, there are 3 types of subtractors:
- Half Subtractor
- Full Subtractor
- Ripple Borrow Subtractor

If adders work by passing forward the carry bit, subtractors work by passing the borrow bit.
