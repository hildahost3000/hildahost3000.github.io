Before we start talking about computers, systems design or hardware, let's go back to where it all started.

### The Two States

Since Aristotle's era in 4th BCE, human started to realize that a lot of things can be described in two states such as:
- yes or no
- on or off
- true or false
- light or dark

This is true in any culture, for example also found in Chinese culture, there is yin and yang.

### Counting

At the same time, human learned how to count. Most likely, it started with counting on their fingers. Therefore, the commonly used numbering system is decimal or base 10, that is from 1 to 10.

This happened during the ancient civilization like Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks. They were developing and growing their empires, they need to keep track of their trades, taxes, and population.

Numbers began to be bigger and it's impossible to rely on paper, let alone fingers. So, during this period, a lot of advancemets in mathemathics were developed such as:
- tools like abacus
- concepts like multiplication and logarithms

However, these methods are still slow and too manual. 

### Mechanical Calculator

As science and engineering advanced, people tried to find faster and more realiable ways to calculate bigger numbers and complex calculations.

Enter Blaise Pascal in 1642 who invented Pascaline, the first mechanical calculator. This device could perform addition and subtraction by rotating wheels forward for addition and backward for subtraction.

Enter Gottfried Wilhelm Leibiz, not long after Pascal, who invented another mechanical calculator. This device could perform multiplication and division by doing repeated addition and subtraction. And instead of wheels and gears, it used stepped drum.

### Binary System

Because of the base 10 mechanical calculator development, Leibniz grew more interested in computation and numbers. He realized we could actually simplify complex numerical number from base 10 to just binary, two digits, 0 and 1.
