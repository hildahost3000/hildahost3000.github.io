To set your expectation and to avoid any confusion, I would like to make a few statements about this website.

### 1. I am not a professional educator

While I try to write accurate and well-researched articles, I do not guarantee that they are all correct. I am not a professional teacher/educator, please do not use my writings as a main source of information. 

### 2. I don't use generative AI

Since I have studied this particular field from my previous undergraduate and graduate studies, I do not use Generative AI to generate the articles. It would betray the purpose of understanding itself. And if that was the case, this website would have been completed in a week.


### 3. English is my third language

I apologize for grammatical errors or language mistakes in my writings.
