title: First Computer
---

If we go back to the very beginning, we talked about mechanical calculator that was manual, heavy, and slow. We also talked about simplifying the base 10 system used on those calculators. By using binary system, we can represent any number just with 0 and 1, we can perform further manipulation using logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT that we call Boolean Algebra.

At this point, these ideas belong to two different fields.
- mechanical calculator implementation is part of practical engineering
- binary system and logical operation is part of abstract mathematics

### About Z3

Enter Konrad Zuse, the very first person who combined the two fields into one single working programmable binary mechanical computer named Z3. 

For reference, he did create two earlier versios which were Z1 and Z2. Since the Z1 was wholly mechanical, although it utilized binary system, it will not be reexplained here.  The Z2 did utilize relays; however, it was limited in functionality because its main purpose was to test the idea of using relays to replace mechanical gears.

Here are some facts about Z3:
- it was a fully programmable using punched tape or a special keyboard as input
- the output will be shown through on/off state on a row of lamps, indicating each digit
- implented using around 2,600 relays
- could perform arithmetic (addition, substraction, multiplication, division) and also square root
- could handle 22 bit (binary digit) in floating points as input and output


### Breaking It Down

But how did we go so quick from inventing the first binary system to creating the first relay to building the first computer?

Or even in more detail, how do we define arithmetic using binary system (0 and 1) and implemented with relays as a switch?

This marks the end of journey of tracing historical invention and discovery. From now on, we will utilize modern knowledge.
