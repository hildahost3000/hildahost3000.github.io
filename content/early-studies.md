title: Early Studies

Up until 16th century, both magnetism and electricity were still often confused as either being the same phenomenon, correlated, causing each other, or even created by celestial forces.

### First Study

This prompted a physicist William Gilbert to conduct his own experiments with lodestones (a known magnet that attracts iron) and amber (a known item that attract small things after being electrically charged). His experiments would later be written in De Magnete and laid out important foundation of the study of magnetism and electricity.

Here are the findings.

1. Because lodestone in compasses align with Earth's north and south, the Earth itself is a giant magnet. Compasses work because of Earth's magnetism, not caused by celestial forces.
2. Magnet has poles, north and south. The opposite poles attract each other, while like poles repel.
3. Magnetism is a property of a certain material, like iron and lodestones. And again, not caused by celestial forces.
4. Rubbing amber temporarily attracts small objects, not just iron. Therefore, electricity is not the same like magnetism.

### More About Electricity

Afterwards, several other discoveries were in line but mostly separated between magnetism and electricity.


#### 1. It is possible to create (static, constant, but limited) electricity. 
   
Otto von Guericke invented a globe made from sulfur that can be rotated with hand. The globe was mounted on an axle, and while moving, it was rubbed against cloth. The friction caused e electricity on the globe.

#### 2. Electricity could flow and it could flow on certain materials better than the others.
   
Stephen Gray was experimenting with electrically charged glass tube that would normally attract small objects. This was known already. However, the cork, that he used initially to protect the tube from moisture and dust, somehow would start attracting small objects from its end when the tube was electrically charged. The electrical charge traveled from the tube to the cork.

Following up, Gray tried to put a small stick of wood, and the charge traveled further to the end of the wood. In the next few days, Gray would experiment with various type of materials. The conclusion of these experiments are:
- electricity could flow 
- it could flow better through certain materials (which we later call as conductors)
- it could stop flowing through certain materials (which we call later as insulators)

#### 3. Electricity has poles.

Cisternay Du Fay discovered that when certain electrically charged materials are put together, sometimes they would repel each other, sometimes they would attract each other.

Therefore, Du Fay classified that there were two types of electrical charges:
- vitreous, for materials like glass 
- resinous, for materials like ambert 
  
#### 4. Electricity flows from positive to negative charge.

Following Du Fay's statement that instead of electricity flowing through two different types of charge, "vitreous" and "resinous", Benjamin Franklin proposed another theory to explain electricity flow called single fluid model of electricity.

The arguments were:
- electricity flow is caused by an excess or deficiency of electric fluid
- electric fluid will flow from materials with excess of fluid to materials with deficiency of fluid

This term will later became universal and is still used until today, with the word "positive" and "negative" charge.

#### 5. It is possible to create a steady and reliable electrical current, which we now know as battery.

Alessandro Volta invented the first true battery while trying to disprove the theory "animal electricity" from Luigi Galvani. 

Galvani experimented with dissected frog legs and probe them with two different metals such as copper, iron, zinc and silver. The legs were placed in a position where the nerves and muscles exposed, and put on a moist conductor like a wet cloth. The first metal probe would be placed to connect two legs in one end, and the other metal probe would connect the other end. 

The experiment discovered that when the metal probe touched the leg, the leg will twitch, despite already dissected. Galvani attributed this to the presence of animal electricity inside the frog leg. Later, we would learn this was partially correct.
  The leg did twitch because of the presence electricity (later, we will learn this as bioelectricity, as in how nerves and muscles work using electric signals in our body)
- However, the electricity did not come from the frog leg itself, but because of the interaction between two metals probes with different materials and the wet cloth, as a moist conductor (later we call this as electrolyte, a substance that conducts electricity)

Volta, too, disagreed and theorized that it was not animal electricity that triggered the leg twitch, it was the different metal probes.

To prove this, he eliminated the proposed animal electricity source, which was the frog legs. Volta used paper that was soaked with a salt solution as a replacement and connected them in both ends with two different types of metal. After several trials with various types of metal, he concluded that:
- an electric current is generated because of the differences in the chemical properties of the two different metal types
- based on this property, metals can be ranked based on their ability to generate electricity

Based on his own experiment, Volta found out that zinc and copper's rank difference was far and thus, good at creating electricity.

Volta created a pile of alternating zinc and copper plates, one separated by an electrolyte before the other. The uppermost and lowermost plate has to be different (either zinc on top and copper on bottom, or vice versa) and the two was connected with wire. Using known methods at that time such as compass and electroscope (a device that detects electric charge), Volta managed to prove that electricity indeed existed not because of animal electricity.

In trying to prove Galvani wrong, Volta invented what was called Voltaic Pile and the first ever battery in history.
