Today is February 20th, 2025. We just got news from France: they were able to run their fusion reactor for 22 minutes. This event outperformed China's latest by 18 minutes! Why do we care?

### What is Fusion Reactor?

Fusion reaction is the process. Adding it with ~or means a device that creates that process happens.

It's like how the Sun makes energy. There are many small particles bumping against each other, producing heat and light. The heat will be used to generate electricity.

People build Fusion Reactor in order to harness energy that is more sustainable than burning fossil fuels and safer than nuclear reactor.


### Reaction

You know atom, it's the element that makes up everything else. Inside an atom, there is nucleus (the core), protons and electrons. 

To start a fusion reaction, we need two nuclei to collide into each other. But, since we want the whole reactor to work, we want two pair of nuclei to collide at the same time, every single time unit (let's say, every second). Therefore, we will use a lof atoms. For real world application, they usually use hydrogen isotopes.

In case you forget, isotopes are just variations of elements (like hydrogen) that has the same number of protons but different number of neutrons (like deuterium and tritium).

### Reactor

In order for the device to trigger a reaction, the hydrogen (as the fuel) will be heated to extremely high temperature like the sun. Millions of degrees of Celcius.

At this situation, the atoms will lose their electrons and they will be in a state called plasma.

Now that all of the atoms will only have protons (all positive), they will repel each other, like magnets. 

### Coulumb Barrier

However, there is a "loophole" in this repulsion. It can be outperformed if we go pass a certain point.

A Coulomb barrier defines the energy required to overcome repulsion between two nuclei. 

$$
U = \frac{k_e \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
$$

- $$U$$: Electrostatic potential energy (in joules)
- $$k_e$$: Coulomb's constant
- $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$: The actual charges of the two particles (in coulombs)
- $$r$$: The distance between the two charges (in meters)

We don't have to care about $$k_e$$ since it's a constant. We don't really have to care about $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$ either, because it's also constant for each nucleus (based on the number of their protons). 

Therefore, the Coulumb barrier $$U$$ for our case will only be defined by the distance $$r$$.

### Kinetic Energy

At this point, there are millions or billions of positive-charged atoms avoiding each other. They are traveling in high speed, while being in a contained space (high density).

They are traveling in high speed because they are in extremely high temperature.

Remember, heat is energy transfer. Because the particles are very hot, they have more energy and the energy has to go somewhere. In this case, it becomes velocity and converted into kinetic energy.

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

Keep in mind that this formula for calculating kinetic energy is only for one particle. We will have to calculate for each particle.

### Overcoming Coulomb Barrier

When we want to jump over a fence, we have to jump higher than the height of the fence.

In our case, to overcome the Coulomb barrier, the "total" kinetic energy between two particles have to be more.

This condition happens not because two positively charged particles decided they want to collide, unlike how we decided we wanted to jump over a fence.

It happens because they have no other choice. Imagine, they are traveling in high speed. Using the repulsion theory, they want to avoid each other. But, because of each of their velocity, they can't help to repulse each other. They accidentally overcome the barrier. 

### Fusion 

When two particles get extremely close, a strong nuclear force will happen. This strong force will pull two nuclei to become single, heavier nucleus. They fuse into one.

The question will be, what will they fuse into? 

Let's take our previous hydrogen isotopes examples: deuterium and tritium. 

Deuterium has 1 proton and 1 neutron.
Tritium has 1 proton and 2 neutrons.

They don't have electrons anymore because we already stripped them away when we put them in high heat.

When they fuse, following the laws of conservation, the new nucleus must have 2 protons and 3 neutrons.

### Finding Fusion Result

Out of all elements and their isotopes, there are 3 possible scenario that will be the fusion result between deuterium and tritium.

1. Helium-3 + 2n
   Helium-3 has 2 protons and 1 neutron.
   The other 2 neutrons are emitted as free neutrons.
2. Helium-4 + 1n
   Helium-4 has 2 protons and 2 neutron.
   The other neutron is emitted as free neutrons.
3. Helium-5
   Helium-5 has 2 protons and 3 neutron.

Helium-5 is unstable and will quickly become another Helium-4 + free neutron. Helium-3 is stable. However, Helium-4 is even more stable. It has 2 proton and 2 neutron, thus making it perfectly symmetrical and balanced. This contributes to stronger nuclear force which will bind them together.

$$
\text{Deuterium } (^2H) + \text{Tritium } (^3H) \rightarrow \text{Helium-4 } (^4He) + \text{Neutron } (n) + \text{Energy}
$$


Therefore, the outcome of the fusion is Helium-4 with 1 free neutron.

### Energy Per Fusion Reaction

Since we now know the before and after product, we can theoretically calculate how much energy we generate from the fusion.

We will use Einstein's equation.

$$
E = \Delta m \cdot c^2
$$

$$\Delta m $$ is the mass deficit between the before and after products. 

The before products:
- Deuterium $$(^2H): 2.014 \, u$$
- Tritium $$(^3H): 3.016 \, u$$

The after products:
- Helium-4 $$ (^4He): 4.002 \, u$$
- Neutron $$(n): 1.009 \, u$$

We have the $$\Delta m $$ as $$0.019u$$ and since Einstein's equation use kilogram, we will convert it using $$1u = 1.66054 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}$$. After that, if we multiply it with the $$c^2$$, or equal to $$9 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2$$, we will get value of the energy
generated from one pair hydrogen isotopes fusion.

### Energy Generation

To put things into perspective, let's talk about real life numbers.

The fusion of one pair hydrogen isotopes creates $$2.84 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{J}$$.

However, in one fusion reactor, there are 177 quintillion fusion reactions happening per second. It's like 177 with 17 zeroes afterwards.

If we multiply that by $$2.84 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{J}$$, we can say we generate around 503 million Joules per second or 503 million Watts (MW).

Our typical phone charger requires 15 Watt. A typical household consumes 900kWh per month. 

With 503 MW, we can theoritically power a medium-size dwith of 1 million people!

### Utilizing the Energy

Let's get back to the fusion reactor. The two hydrogen isotopes fused into one Helium, the energy is released in the form of light and heat. This is why the Sun is hot and bright.

The light, we cannot utilize it (yet).

The heat, we captured in on the reactor walls, with a blanket made of lithium. This interaction will breed more tritium, that we can use to fuel the next fusion and keeps the process going.

The rest of the heat, we capture and exchange it to produce steam to run turbines. Then we connect the turbines to generate electricity.

### Conclusion
