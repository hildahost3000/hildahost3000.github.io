title: Welcome to Hilda's Library!

Hello, I'm Hilda. 

I'm a project engineer who focused on developing solutions to improve efficiency in the manufacturing industry. I studied Computer Engineerning (B. Eng) and Project Management (MBA), which gave me good understanding of running projects both from technical and business perspectives.

In the past, I have worked on projects involving machine learning and cost reduction strategies. Nowadays, I'm working on constrained optimization problems. While my primary focus has been on delevoping core functionality, recently I have been practicing full-stack development to build complete deployable systems.

Learning new technologies requires constant research, which inspired me to organize and document my own knowledge.
