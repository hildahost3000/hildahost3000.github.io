title: D Flip-Flop
---
D Flip-Flop stands for either Data or Delay Flip Flop. This sequential logic circuit is used for memory element, because it can store a single bit of data.

It takes a single output D and a clock input CLK. The output is a stored value Q and the complement of Q called Q bar.

The output changes when the clock transitions, specifically on the edge of the clock signal.

The output Q always follows D at the time when the clock is "rising". Clock signals is either low and high and it repeats indefinitely. The change from low to high is what we call "rising" and only during this period of time, the D will be transferred to Q and saved as the stored value until the next rising clock signal.
