title: Electricity

Let's go back to the beginning, one more time.

During the long period of time where people were observing the existence of two states (yes/no, on/off, true/false), people also observed this mysterious phenomenon that will later be known as electricity. But before that, let's talk about trees.

### Resin

Since million years ago, trees such as pine trees and other cone-bearing trees (called conifers) produce sticky, high viscousity liquid called resin. Resin is produced as a defense mechanism to protect themselves and make sure they can survive.

They produce resin for:
- sealing wounds - when their branch is broken, resin will flow to cover the "wounded" area so they don't rot and decay
- traps insects - because resin itself is sticky, insects will get trapped when trying to lay eggs or dig a hole
- protect against fungi and bacteria - resin contains antimicrobial and antifungal compounds that can kill or inhibit the growth of harmful fungi and bacteria
- support tree structure - resin will get hardened over the time and can help strengthening the tree support

### Fossilization

These trees produce resin all the time. Sometimes, the oozed out resin from the tree would drip to the ground. Over the time, these resin on the ground would be buried by sand, rock, water, decayed animals, decayed plants, and all natural things that might happen in the span of million years. The volatile elements on the resin such as oils and alcohols would evaporate and make the resin dryer.

In chemical elements, the dry resin is now mostly $$(\text{C}_5\text{H}_8)_n$$. And not only the extra layers, the resin was also subjected by heat and pressure, making it dry even further.

The lack of oxygen (O), the protection from bacteria and fungi, and the isolation from other environmental factors, succesfully created a stable environment for a chemical change to occur to the resin. This chemical reaction is called polymerization.

Here is how it happens:
- heat and pressure activate the carbon and hydrogen inside the resin
- because they are more reactive, they can form chemical bonds with each other
- at first it's like a linear chain, but they start to do cross-links and becomes three-dimensional networks
- this process made the resin hardened and chemically stable, or we call it durable

This million years long process we also call fossiliziation. And the result of a fossilized resin is called an amber (stone
).

Keep in mind that these amber are deposited still underneath a lot of layers.

### Amber

Over million of years, the earth underwent a lot of geological processes like earthquakes (tectonic plate movements), volcanic activities, rain, wind, and other natural processes. These would eventually bring the amber back to the surface and carried away to places through water streams like rivers and sea.

Amber pieces are lightweight, so they naturally float on water. And at some point, they started being found by human including the earliest note by Ancient Greeks in 600 BCE. The Greek word for amber is "elektron" which later will be the root for "electricity".

### Electricity

The earliest recorded observation of electricity was made by Thales of Miletus in 600 BCE. Ancient Greeks discovered that rubbing amber stones with fur will make the stones atttract small objects.

Apart from that, human observed this natural phenomenon through various experiences:
- lightning during thunderstorms in the sky
- clothes made by certain types of fabric sticking to each other after being worn
- sparks when touching metal objects, especially in dry weather
- electric fish can shock and the shock can travel through human body
